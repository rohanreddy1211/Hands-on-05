The Python generic Heap class is implemented in this project.

This implementation of Python supports:

a generic heap structure that supports a wide range of data types, including floats, ints, and custom datastructures.
The property of the min-heap in which the root is always the smallest element.
Operations with heaps:
adding additional components to the pile.
lifting the root element and putting the heap property back in place.
From an unsorted/random array, create a min-heap.
getting the heap's root element back without removing it.
